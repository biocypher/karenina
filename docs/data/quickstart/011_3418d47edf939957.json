    "content": "# Venetoclax Drug Target\n\nVenetoclax's approved drug target is **BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)**.\n\n## Key Details:\n\n- **Mechanism**: Venetoclax is a selective BCL2 inhibitor that binds to the BH3-binding groove of BCL2, preventing it from sequestering pro-apoptotic proteins\n- **Result**: This promotes apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells that are dependent on BCL2 for survival\n\n## FDA-Approved Indications:\n\n1. **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)** - with or without del(17p)\n2. **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)** - in combination with hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine\n3. **Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)**\n\nVenetoclax is particularly effective in CLL patients with deletion 17p or TP53 mutations, which are traditionally associated with poor prognosis.",
