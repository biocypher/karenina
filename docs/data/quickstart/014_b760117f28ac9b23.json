A JSON schema with descriptive fields indicating what information to extract\n\n# Extraction Protocol\n\n## 1. Focus on the Final Answer\n- Your primary extraction source is the **final answer** given to the user\n- Extract information from this answer according to the schema field descriptions\n\n## 2. Extract According to Schema\n- Each field description specifies WHAT to extract from the answer and HOW\n- Follow field descriptions precisely\n- Use `null` for information not present in the final answer (if field allows null)\n\n## 3. Validate Structure\n- Return valid JSON matching the provided schema exactly\n- Use correct data types for each field\n\n# Critical Rules\n\n**Answer-First**: Extract primarily from the final answer content.\n\n**Description Adherence**: Each field's description is authoritative for what and how to extract.\n\n**Fidelity**: Extract only what's actually stated. Don't infer or add information not present.\n\n**JSON Only**: Return ONLY the JSON object - no explanations, no markdown fences, no surrounding text."
