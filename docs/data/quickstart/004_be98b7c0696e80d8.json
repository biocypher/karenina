For every attribute in the provided ground-truth specification, produce a short, direct description that explains exactly what the judge should read for in the response and how to answer. Highlight boolean expectations clearly.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Reference attribute names verbatim.\n- Mention the expected type implicitly via phrasing (e.g., \"Answer with true or false if ...\" for booleans, \"Provide the count of ...\" for numeric fields).\n- For boolean attributes checking concept presence, allow semantic equivalence and related terms rather than requiring exact string matches. Focus on whether the underlying concept is conveyed.\n- When relevant, reference concrete response-focused examples such as \"Number of interacting genes mentioned in the response\" or \"Does the response cite a control group?\" to reinforce that extraction happens from the candidate answer.\n- Stay concise (<= 2 sentences per attribute).\n- Return only valid JSON.\n\nExample mapping:\n{{\n  \"field_descriptions\": {{\n    \"count_of_items\": \"Provide an integer equal to the number of items mentioned in the response.\",\n    \"mentions_first_concept\": \"Answer with true if the response refers to the first concept or semantically related terms; otherwise answer false.\",\n    \"mentions_second_concept\": \"Answer with true if the response refers to the second concept or semantically related terms; otherwise answer false.\",\n    \"classification_level\": \"Select the classification level mentioned in the response from the available options.\"\n  }}\n}}"

For boolean concept checks, focus on semantic meaning rather than exact word matching. Make it explicit that the judge is reading the candidate response to this question.\n\nReturn only valid JSON."
