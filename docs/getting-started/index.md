## Recommended Reading Order

If you're new to Karenina, read these pages in order:

1. **[Installation](installation.md)** — Install Karenina and set up API keys
2. **[Quick Start](../notebooks/quickstart.ipynb)** — Run your first benchmark end-to-end
3. **[Workspace Init](workspace-init.md)** — Set up a project directory with `karenina init`

Once you're comfortable, move on to [Core Concepts](../core-concepts.md) for a deeper understanding of checkpoints, templates, rubrics, and adapters.
