## Recommended Reading Order

If you're new to Karenina, read these pages in order:

1. **[Introduction](01-introduction/index.md)** — Understand the two-unit evaluation approach (templates for correctness, rubrics for quality)
2. **[Installation](02-installation/index.md)** — Install Karenina and set up API keys
3. **[Quick Start](quickstart.md)** — Run your first benchmark end-to-end
4. **[Configuration](03-configuration/index.md)** — Learn how presets, environment variables, and CLI arguments interact

Once you're comfortable, move on to [Core Concepts](04-core-concepts/index.md) for a deeper understanding of checkpoints, templates, rubrics, and adapters.
