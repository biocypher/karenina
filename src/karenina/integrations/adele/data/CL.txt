Level 0: None. The task requires no conceptualization, learning, abstraction, inductive or analogical reasoning. It involves applying well-established procedures or recalling known information, even for complex tasks. No new abstractions, analogies, or learning occur during task execution.
Examples:
* Performing basic one-digit arithmetic multiplications using memorized multiplication tables (like 3x3 = 9).
* Sorting short texts into predefined categories based on a list of indicator words, without inferring new indicators.
* What was the name of Abraham Lincoln’s father?

Level 1: Very Low. The task involves minimal conceptualization, learning, inductive or analogical reasoning. It requires simple pattern identification or following basic instructions, with very limited generalization or basic surface-level analogies occurring during the task.
Examples:
* "Continuing a basic letter sequence (e.g., “a, c, e, g, __”).
* “Given a red circle, a red square, a red triangle and a blue pentagon, find the one out, which is the blue pentagon.”
* Given a pair of words (like "hot and cold"), choose another pair from a list that shares the same relationship. For example, if "hot" and "cold" are opposites, you'd look for another opposite pair like "up and down."

Level 2: Low. The task requires basic conceptualization, learning, inductive and analogical reasoning. It involves generalizing from a small set of examples, applying simple analogies to closely related domains, or applying simple instructions to new but closely related tasks.
Examples:
* Given the sentence ‘As it started raining, Alice opened her brolly.’ inferring the meaning of the unknown word (brolly) by using surrounding context clues, forming a basic abstraction about its possible definition.
* In a fictional planet, observing in a garden where light yellow and light orange plants grow towards light sources over time but dark blue and dark red plants don’t, and forming a basic hypothesis between the colors and plant behavior.
* Adapting a solution from a previously solved secondary school math problem to a new problem with very similar structure but different surface features (e.g. numbers, names and context). While the core mathematical approach remains similar, the adaptation still requires recognizing how small variations in the new problem might require adjustments to the original solution method.

Level 3: Intermediate. The task involves moderate conceptualization, learning, and inductive and analogical reasoning. It requires recognizing broader patterns, applying analogies across moderately different domains, and forming more complex hypotheses through analogical reasoning.
Examples:
* Reading passages where certain words are consistently replaced with nonsense words: 'The zork lives in a tree. The small zork ate berries. Many zorks gather in winter [...]. The tired zork slept quietly'. Through the multiple examples, learning not just that 'zork' likely means 'squirrel', but also understanding how it follows plural rules ('zorks'), can be modified by adjectives ('small zork', 'tired zork'), and performs actions typical of animals.
* While playing a strategy game named Xiangqi (also known as Chinese chess) without any prior experience on it, coming up with some effective tactics through repeated observations and trials as well as some past experience playing chess.
* Given data about plant growth in artificial conditions where light color, temperature, and humidity vary cyclically, observing that plants develop different leaf patterns depending on which factor changes first each day. Through systematic observation, forming basic hypotheses about how the sequence of environmental changes affects growth patterns.

Level 4: High. The task requires substantial conceptualization, inductive and analogical reasoning, and abstraction, involving the integration of multiple concepts, creating complex analogical mappings across diverse domains, and forming and testing complex hypotheses.
Examples:
* Working with a collection of text messages where response times vary significantly. Through analysis, discovering that certain word combinations, sentence structures, and punctuation patterns consistently correlate with faster or slower response times, then using these insights to predict likely response speeds for new messages.
* While learning Go after experience with chess and Xiangqi, discovering how stone formations serve multiple strategic purposes that differ fundamentally from piece-based games. Through systematic play and analysis, understanding how a group of stones can simultaneously secure territory, threaten invasion, and maintain connectivity with other groups. This requires substantial abstraction beyond piece-movement games to grasp how value emerges from stone relationships rather than individual pieces.
* Working with a sequence of pattern acceptance tests where rules change systematically. For instance, in judging whether grid arrangements of colored shapes are "valid": early patterns are accepted based on color adjacency (e.g., "red must never touch blue"), then the rule shifts to consider shape orientation (e.g., "triangles must point toward squares"), and finally combines both aspects (e.g., "red triangles must point toward blue squares"). The systematic nature of the rule changes follows a clear progression from simple single-attribute rules to combined rules. The subject must track these rule evolutions to correctly predict which new grid arrangements would be considered valid, understanding that rules become progressively more complex by combining previous attributes rather than introducing entirely new concepts.

Level 5: Very High. The task involves very advanced conceptualization, inductive and analogical reasoning, and abstraction. It requires generating new analogical frameworks in real-time, mapping relationships across highly diverse and abstract domains, or solving complex problems through novel analogical insights.
Examples:
* Solving a visual puzzle where three different properties (symmetry, rotation, and scaling) must be understood at both the element level and the pattern level. For instance, individual shapes follow one set of transformation rules, while the overall arrangement follows a different set of rules, and the relationship between these two rule sets must be discovered to predict the next state.
* Designing a new electronic musical instrument after studying blueprints of synthesizers, amplifiers, and effect pedals. This requires abstracting core principles of signal generation, processing, and control from each device (oscillation, filtering, envelope shaping, feedback), understanding how these principles create different sonic characteristics, and then creatively recombining them to produce new types of sounds. The task demands identifying how fundamental concepts manifest differently across devices (like how feedback creates sustain in an amplifier but modulation in a ring modulator), then synthesizing these insights to create sound-generating mechanisms.
* Working with a sequence of pattern acceptance tests where rules evolve with increasing abstraction and self-reference. Starting from 'red triangles must point toward blue squares', patterns evolve to where shapes establish relationships based on their relative properties. For instance, shapes with more sides must point toward shapes with fewer sides, but this relationship inverts when the shapes share colors. Furthermore, each valid pattern must mirror a small-scale arrangement within its larger structure - if three triangles form a particular relationship on one side of the grid, the overall shape arrangement of the entire grid must follow that same relationship. The subject must discover these nested self-referential patterns and predict how they apply at different scales, requiring both pattern recognition and the generation of new frameworks for understanding how rules can reference themselves.
